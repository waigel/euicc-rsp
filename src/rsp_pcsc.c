/*
 * rsp_pcsc.c -- the transport that carries bytes to actual hardware, PC/SC.
 *
 * PC/SC (PC/Smart Card, the interface both macOS and Linux expose under the
 * same function names, winscard.h) is the one place in this library that
 * touches a card reader instead of a recording. It implements the same
 * rsp_transport_t the replay transport (src/rsp_transport.c) does, and
 * nothing above this file -- rsp_es10_send, rsp_card_read_info, the command
 * layer later tasks build -- can tell the two apart.
 *
 * macOS ships PC/SC as a framework: <PCSC/winscard.h> and <PCSC/wintypes.h>,
 * linked with -framework PCSC. Linux has no PC/SC of its own; pcsc-lite is
 * the interface's reference implementation there, and its single header is
 * plain <winscard.h> (it already pulls in pcsclite.h, which is where
 * wintypes.h's macOS split lives on that side). The two are not textually
 * identical, but they define the same names -- SCARDCONTEXT, SCardConnect,
 * SCARD_PCI_T0, and so on -- so everything past this #if is written once.
 *
 * PC/SC's own functions return a signed LONG; every nonzero value is a
 * failure and SCARD_S_SUCCESS (0) is the only success. This file only ever
 * surfaces two of the numbers rsp.h defines: 0 for done, and -2 for "the
 * exchange could not happen" -- transceive's own -1 ("the card answered
 * something unusable") is reserved for an answer that arrived and made no
 * sense, which is not something PC/SC's return code, only the response
 * bytes, could ever tell us. Every failure here also prints a sentence:
 * pcsc_stringify_error's own text for the ones this file has no more to
 * say about, and a hand-written one for the three failures a person
 * actually hits -- no reader attached, a reader with an empty tray, and
 * another process already holding the card (SCARD_E_SHARING_VIOLATION),
 * which on macOS is almost always the system's own card services, not
 * this program's fault at all.

     * combined request with SCARD_W_UNRESPONSIVE_CARD even though the
     * exact same card connects fine when asked for T0 alone -- the stack
     * mishandles the combined request, not the request itself, and there
     * is nothing on this side of the interface that makes that go away.
     * Measured cold (the card left idle ~90s, nothing else asked of it
     * since): the combined request takes just over 18 seconds to fail
     * that way before anything gets a chance to retry.
     *
     * SCardGetStatusChange does not have this cost -- it never talks to
     * the card at all, only to the reader's own cached notion of what is
     * inserted, and it hands back the ATR as part of that. So: read the
     * ATR first, with a zero timeout (asks for the current state, does
     * not wait for a change), and use atr_protocol_mask to work out which
     * single protocol the card itself is offering. When that comes back
     * as exactly one protocol, ask for that one directly, first --
     * skipping the doomed combined attempt entirely rather than paying
     * for it and then falling back. When the ATR could not be read, could
     * not be parsed, or genuinely offers both protocols, there is no
     * reason yet to expect the combined request to fail, so it is still
     * asked for first, unchanged from before.
     *
     * Either way, the original try-each-protocol sequence stays as the
     * net: if the ATR's own answer turns out to be wrong for some reason
     * this walk did not anticipate, or the ATR was unreadable to begin
     * with, every protocol still gets tried in turn before this function
     * gives up. A silent fallback that happens to work is only marginally
     * better than a loud failure that does not -- either way the next
     * person has no way to tell what actually happened -- so every
     * attempt after the first, and the protocol that ultimately got
     * negotiated, is reported on stderr. If every attempt fails, the
     * error reported and returned is the first attempt's: whichever
     * request was tried first is the one whose failure is actually
     * diagnostic, where "protocol mismatch" from a later retry is not
     * telling you anything you did not already ask for. */
