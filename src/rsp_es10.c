/*
 * rsp_es10.c -- one ES10 request driven to the ISD-R and the whole answer
 * collected back, chaining outward in blocks and inward through 61xx/GET
 * RESPONSE.
 *
 * SGP.22 v2.6 section 5.7.2 "Transport Command" states: "One generic APDU
 * is used on the interfaces ES10a, ES10b and ES10c to transport all command
 * request and command response data. All functions use the command message
 * STORE DATA as defined in GlobalPlatform Card Specification [8] with the
 * specific coding defined below" (Table 47):
 *
 *     CLA   '80'-'83' or 'C0'-'CF'   (GPCS [8] section 11.1.4)
 *     INS   'E2'                     STORE DATA
 *     P1    '11' or '91'             see Table 48
 *     P2    'xx'                     Block number
 *     Lc    Var.
 *     Data  the DER-encoded ES10 command/response data object
 *     Le    '00'
 *
 * Table 48 gives P1's bits: b8 is "More blocks/Last block" (0/1); the
 * fixed bits below it (b7b6='00' no general encryption info, b5b4='10'
 * BER-TLV data, b1='1' ISO case 4) are the same for every ES10 exchange,
 * so the two P1 values actually used are '11' (more blocks follow) and
 * '91' (this is the last block) -- exactly GPCS's own STORE DATA P1
 * table (section 11.11.2.1, Table 11-89) restricted to those two shapes.
 * P2 is "Block number"; GPCS section 11.11.2.2 pins the concrete rule
 * SGP.22 only names: "coded sequentially from '00' to 'FF'", reset at the
 * start of a session -- SGP.22 v2.6 section 2.5.5 says the same for a BPP
 * segment ("At the beginning of each segment the block number of the
 * STORE DATA commands SHALL be reset"). This code resets it to 0 for
 * every call, since one rsp_es10_send call is exactly one such session.
 *
 * The CLA byte's range leaves room for a logical channel number in its
 * low bits (GPCS section 11.1.4.1, Table 11-11: '80'-'83' is "GlobalPlatform
 * command, no secure messaging", channel 0-3 in b2b1); this library has no
 * notion of a logical channel, so it always uses channel 0, CLA '80'.
 *
 * The maximum block size is not restated in section 5.7.2 itself, but
 * SGP.22 v2.6 section 2.5.5 ("Segmented Bound Profile Package") and
 * section 5.7.6 (LoadBoundProfilePackage) both give it for the same STORE
 * DATA mechanism: "Each segment ... that is up to 255 bytes is transported
 * in one APDU. Larger TLVs are sent in blocks of 255 bytes for the first
 * blocks and a last block that MAY be shorter." This matches GPCS section
 * 11.1.5: "All GlobalPlatform APDU command messages (excluding the APDU
 * header) are limited to 255 bytes in length" -- an Lc that is one byte
 * wide, the short-APDU form Table 47 uses (Lc 'Var.', no extended length
 * anywhere in this clause).
 *
 * For the answer, section 5.7.2 continues: "if the size of the response is
 * bigger than 256 bytes, the chaining of the commands SHALL be done as
 * defined in ISO/IEC 7816-4 [14]. The responses SHALL be retrieved by the
 * Device using several GET RESPONSE commands" -- the same rule GPCS section
 * 11.1.5.2 "Response Chaining" states for any GlobalPlatform command:
 * "the chaining mechanism defined in [ISO 7816-4], using the '61xx' status
 * word and multiple GET RESPONSE commands, should be used." GET RESPONSE's
 * own encoding (CLA '00', INS 'C0', P1 '00', P2 '00', Le = the SW2 that
 * accompanied '61xx') is ISO/IEC 7816-4's, which neither SGP.22 nor GPCS
 * restates; this is the ordinary GET RESPONSE any ISO 7816-4 reader issues
 * after a '61xx' procedure byte.
 *
 * Section 5.7.2's "Processing State Returned in the Response Message"
 * gives the status words that end an exchange successfully: "A successful
 * execution of the APDU command SHALL be indicated by the status bytes
 * '90 00' if no proactive command is pending and by '91 XX' if a proactive
 * command (e.g., REFRESH) is pending." This function's contract (see
 * rsp.h) only treats a bare '90 00' as the terminal success and anything
 * that is not '90 00' or '61xx' as a refusal reported through *sw -- so a
 * '91 XX' (a real, spec-defined success that also signals a pending
 * proactive command) reads as a refusal here. That is narrower than
 * section 5.7.2 allows; deciding what to do about a pending proactive
 * command is left to whichever caller needs it, not this function.
 *
 * What an intermediate block's response must look like is section 5.7.6's,
 * not GPCS's: SGP.22 v2.6 section 5.7.6 (LoadBoundProfilePackage),
 * "Response Data": "The data presence in the response message depends on
 * the block status: For an intermediate block of data of a BPP TLV, the
 * response message SHALL not contain data field." (GPCS section 11.1.5.1
 * states a same-shaped rule for its own "more commands" chaining, but that
 * clause opens by naming exactly which commands it governs -- DELETE,
 * INSTALL and PUT KEY -- and STORE DATA is not one of them, so it is not
 * this rule's source.) A bare '90 00' is therefore the only response an
 * intermediate block may legitimately receive; a '90 00' that arrives
 * with a data field anyway is the card breaking that rule, not a status
 * this function's caller can reason about through *sw the way rsp.h
 * documents it (a genuine refusal status) -- so that case is reported as
 * -2, same as any other exchange that could not happen, not as -1 with
 * *sw holding the paradox of "refused, status 9000".
 *
 * The inward response-collection loop is bounded in both directions a
 * non-terminating chain could otherwise exploit: GPCS section 11.1.5
 * caps what one exchange can carry ("a maximum length of 256 bytes of
 * response data") and caps every other length field in the spec at a
 * 3-byte BER-TLV encoding ("3 bytes for a length up to 65535, except
 * where otherwise stated") -- so 65535 bytes total and, since reaching
 * that many bytes at 256 per round trip takes at most 256 round trips,
 * 256 GET RESPONSE round trips are the ceiling this function accepts
 * before refusing to keep chaining. Both bounds exist because a card (or
 * a hand-edited recording) that keeps answering '61xx' forever is the
 * same failure the brief warns about elsewhere -- "a card that simply
 * stops answering" -- wearing a different hat: a card that never stops
 * *promising* an answer hangs this function exactly as badly as one that
 * never answers at all, unless something here refuses to keep waiting.
